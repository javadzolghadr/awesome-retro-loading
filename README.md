## !important Note

You don’t need to waste hours chasing that “perfect retro look” anymore. This file gives you a plug-and-play vaporwave loading screen so you can stop obsessing over the visuals and focus on building your actual project.

Retro aesthetics are cool — but they’re also just a fad. They won’t make your product better. They won’t make you richer. So stop tweaking neon gradients for hours, bro. Drop this in, move on, and build something that matters.
